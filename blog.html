                    <h2> My First Demo poject (Analog Clock) </h2>
                    <br>
                    <p>

                        We will fabricate a constant simple clock utilizing HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

                        Essential:

                        Fundamental comprehension of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
                        Approach: We will make three documents (HTML record, a CSS record, and JavaScript Document), we
                        likewise have a picture of the clock that will be utilized behind the scenes, and what's more,
                        we will make 60 minutes, moment, and second hand (utilizing HTML and CSS).
                        These hands will turn according to the framework time (we will utilize the predefined Date capability of JavaScript to
                        work out the level of revolutions of each hand).

                        HTML: It is a straightforward document having the essential construction of the site page and ID
                        for the clock's body and for the second, minute, hour hands.
                        CSS: The CSS is utilized only for making the clock really look a piece more pleasant. We have
                        essentially focused our clock in the page.
                        JavaScript: The JavaScript document will give the rationale behind the pivot of the hands.
                        Model:

                        First we have chosen the hour, moment, and second from HTML.
                        To get the ongoing time we have utilized the Date() object given by the JavaScript. This will
                        give the ongoing seconds, minutes, and hours individually.
                        Presently, we have our hour, moment, and second, and we realize that the clock pivots 360
                        degrees. Thus, we will switch over completely to change over the pivot of the hands of the clock
                        into degrees. The degree estimation depends on a straightforward unary strategy.
