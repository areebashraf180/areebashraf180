                    Software Development Services has long been the popular choice of many firms as they not only save
                    time for a specific project or task but also allow companies to access more professionals as well as
                    experts at a reasonable cost than in-house development. And in the world where mostly everyone has
                    to work remotely from home, Software Development Services has never been more appealing.
                    <br>

                    “Software development is the process of conceiving, specifying, designing, programming, documenting,
                    testing, and bug fixing involved in creating and maintaining applications, frameworks, or other
                    software components. Software development is a process of writing and maintaining the source code,
                    but in a broader sense, it includes all that is involved between the conception of the desired
                    software through to the final manifestation of the software, sometimes in a planned and structured
                    process”
                    <br>
                    Software Development is an intriguing yet very complex thing which would normally go through a lot
                    of processes. Each step should not be taken lightly since the success of a project depends on them.
                    Here we will take you through the 7 Software Development Processes that Savvycom follows:
